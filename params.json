  "tagline": "Which should you choose?",
  "body": "### Problem\r\nOur project explores how the operating system uses a process scheduler by implementing two scheduling algorithms FIFO AND STCF. The idea of scheduling has many applications outside of the operating system. This idea touches industries such as delivery, manufacturing, etc making this knowledge transferable. By comparing the two schedulers using average turnaround time and response time, the difference between non-preemptive and preemptive schedulers can be demonstrated. In the simulation it can be expected that STCF will have a shorter turnaround time.\r\n\r\n### The Weird Stuff\r\nWeâ€™ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
