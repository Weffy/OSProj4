<p>Our project explores how the operating system uses a process scheduler by implementing three scheduling algorithms FIFO SJF and RR. The idea of scheduling has many applications outside of the operating system. This idea touches industries such as delivery, manufacturing, etc making this knowledge transferable. </p>

<p>By comparing the three schedulers using average turnaround time and response time, the difference between non-preemptive and preemptive schedulers can be demonstrated. </p>

<p>These performance metrics are calculated using the following formulas.</p>

<p>Response Time = Start Time - Arrival Time
Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Start Time</p>

<p>The part that we found most interesting is where we tried to simulate a multi core processor. We were interested to see how much improvement multiple cores could make. Unfortunately, we did not plan ahead for the concurrency issues that awaited us. This required us to rethink about how the code was setup. Some of the methods were handling too many tasks. Once we cleaned things up and refactored the code, we were able to isolate the insert, and getTask methods. These were significant because we felt that these two methods were the two critical sections that needed to be synchronized. Once we set the methods to synchronized, everything was back to running smoothly.</p>

<p>Using multiple cores increases throughput at slightly less than linear rate.</p>
